## Project Overview
-------------------
In this project, we created an implementation of the board game [Machi Koro](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143884/machi-koro). The game itself is composed of a deck of cards, a pair of dice, and a set of coins. The cards come in two varieties, establishments and landmarks. Establishments are cards that activate depending on the result of the die/dice roll. Landmarks are cards that give constant benefits once they are constructed. Each player begins with specific starting cards---the *Wheat Field* and *Bakery* establishments, along with the four landmark cards (*Train Station* (4 coins), *Shopping Mall* (10 coins), *Amusement Park* (16 coins), and *Radio Tower* (22 coins)). The first player to construct all four landmarks wins the game. Consult the [detailed rules](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ehpxe4aa6n0ee98/P_MK_Rulebook_7418%20%281%29.pdf) or [the Watch It Played video](https://youtu.be/X6y02IGRE-U) to fully understand how to play.

The entire set of cards can be seen below:

## Project Details
------------------
### Prioritized Features
This is the backlog items we pulled and will be explained in detail below:

1. Display the detailed view of each card on the console (Phase 0).
2. Play the Phase 1 console version of the game with 2 human players.
3. Play the Phase 1 console version of the game with 1 human and 1 random AI player.
4. Play the Phase 2 console version of the game with 1 human and 1 or 2 random AI players.
5. Play the Phase 3 console version of the game with 1 human and 1 or 2 random AI players.
6. Play the Phase 4 console version of the game with 1 human and 1, 2, or 3 random AI players.
7. Play the Phase 5 console version of the game with 1 human and 1, 2, or 3 random AI players.
8. Play the Phase 6 console version of the game with 1 human and 1, 2, or 3 random AI players.
9. Play the Phase 6 console version of the game with 1 human, 1 strategic AI, and 0, 1, or 2 random AI players.

### Definition of Done
The *definition of done* for **any** feature is that it passes all automated acceptance tests, has a codebase that achieves at least 80% branch coverage from its unit tests, has a fully documented API, and has clear end-user documentation for using the software to play the game. This end-user documentation should be in the form of a Markdown file called "UserGuide.md".

Each of the first eight features comes with one or more automated acceptance tests. The remaining features require the product owner to certify that acceptance has been achieved by using the software manually.


### Phases
The phases referred to in the feature statements are described below. For each phase, the program should allow the first command line argument to be the phase. For Phase 1, the program should also accept an optional argument `--ai` that determines whether the opponent is another human (if `--ai` is absent) or a the random AI player (if `--ai` is present). For the remainder of the phases through Feature 8, the program should take two arguments---the phase and the number of players (which can be used to determine how many AI players should be used).

For example, to satisfy Feature 7, the program would be run as follows:

`java -jar build/libs/machiwoco.jar phase5 3`

which would run the program in Phase 5 mode with 3 players (1 human and 2 AI). In all cases, the first player is always human.


#### Phase 0
In Phase 0, there is no actual "game". Instead, the full view of the establishments (in order of activation) followed by landmarks is printed to the screen in the following format.

#### Phase 1
In the Phase 1 version of the game, the only establishments available will be the *Wheat Field*, *Ranch*, and *Forest* (all blue), and the only landmark will be a new one created solely for this purpose, the *City Hall*. The *City Hall* costs 7 coins to construct. It has no game effect, and its description should simply be "You have a city hall." All players start with a single *Wheat Field*, and there are 6 of each of the three establishments in the market. The first player to complete the *City Hall* wins the game.

#### Phase 2
The Phase 2 version of the game builds on Phase 1 by adding the *Bakery*, *Convenience Store*, *Mine*, and *Apple Orchard*. Players start with a single *Wheat Field* and *Bakery*, with 6 of each of the seven establishments in the market. It also includes the *Train Station* to go along with the *City Hall* landmark. The first player to complete both landmarks wins the game. (Note that the *Train Station* allows players to roll 1 or 2 dice, and there are establishments that require two dice to activate.)

#### Phase 3
The Phase 3 version builds on Phase 2 by adding the *Cheese Factory*, *Furniture Factory*, and *Farmers Market*. Starting cards are the same as in Phase 2, and each establishment has 6 copies in the market. It adds the *Shopping Mall* landmark in addition to the *Train Station* and *City Hall*. The first player to complete all landmarks wins the game. (Note that the *Shopping Mall* effect only applies to Bread icons in this phase, since there are no Cup icon cards yet.)

#### Phase 4
The Phase 4 version builds on Phase 3 by adding the *Cafe* and *Family Restaurant*, and (as always) there are 6 copies of each in the market. It also removes the *City Hall* from the landmarks and adds the *Amusement Park*. The first plyaer to complete all three landmarks wins the game. (Note that the *Shopping Mall* now has Cup icons to affect, and the *Amusement Park* allows an extra turn if a player rolls doubles, ie. the same value on both dice.)

#### Phase 5
The Phase 5 version builds on Phase 4 by adding the major (purple) establishments (*Stadium*, *TV Station*, and *Business Center*), as well as the *Radio Tower* landmark. This now represents the full game as presented in the rulebook. The first player to complete all four landmarks wins the game. (Note that the major establishments cannot be "stacked"---a player can only own one copy of each. Note also that the *Radio Tower* allows the player the choice to reroll once per turn.)

#### Phase 6
The Phase 6 version is identical to Phase 5, except that the market is handled as described in the "Hybrid Supply Variant" section of the rules (commonly called the "5-5-2 market"). For most players, this is the "standard" market, whereas the market we've used so far would be considered the "simple" market.


### AI Approaches
#### Random AI
The random AI player always chooses uniformly randomly among its choices. For the decision to roll one or two dice, or to reroll the dice, it has a 50% chance of choosing either. For the decision of choosing an opponent (as a target, for the *TV Station* or *Business Complex*), it has a uniform/equal chance of choosing any available opponent. For the decision to choose a building (for the *Business Complex*), it has a uniform/equal chance of choosing any of the available building options.

#### Strategic AI
The strategic AI player makes prioritized decisions about what establishments to buy and landmarks to construct, as well as which players/establishments to target. The strategy in each circumstance is communicated in the [User Guide](https://github.com/zifangu/Machi-Koro-Digitization/blob/master/UserGuide.md)


### Interfaces

##### Start of Game 
The game should start with the notification "The game has started. Player *N* will go    
first." (where *N* is the starting player number).

##### Beginning of Turn
A turn should start with the notification "Turn started for Player *N*." (where *N* is the player's number).

##### Current Game State
The current game state looks like the following:

##### Roll
A roll should be notified as follows: "Player *N* rolled [3] = 3." or "Player *N* rolled [1][4] = 5." Each die value should be put in its own square brackets, with the total roll following an equals sign. For a single die roll, the value in the brackets would be the same as the total.

##### Establishment Activation
An establishment activation should be notified as follows: "Forest activated for Player *N*." using the *Forest* as an example.

##### Establishment Purchase or Landmark Construction
A purchase or construction should be notified as follows: "Player *N* purchased the Furniture Factory." using the *Furniture Factory* as an example establishment, or "Player *N* constructed the Shopping Mall." using the *Shopping Mall* as an example landmark. If the player chooses not to purchase or construct, the notification should say "Player *N* chose not to make improvements."

##### End of Turn
A turn should end with the notification "Turn ended for Player *N*."

##### End of Game
A game should end with a notification of the final game state (as described above), along with the notification "The game is over. Player *N* is the winner."
   

##### Human Interface Menus/Queries
The console interface should also provide the following menus/queries for human players:
* the menu of establishments and landmarks that a player can purchase
* the query of whether to roll 1 or 2 dice (if *Train Station* is constructed)
* the query to reroll the dice (if *Radio Tower* is constructed)
* the menu of which player to choose (if *TV Station* or *Business Complex* is activated)
* the menu of which establishment to choose (if *Business Complex* is activated)


###### Market Menu
The market menu should provide a numbered list of the market establishments and landmark options. The options should begin and end with a single line of 42 equals signs. Each subsequent line should list the option number as a two digit string, right-aligned and space-padded, followed by a dot/period, followed by a single space. The establishment entries should mimic those in the market and player inventories from the game state (18-character name, color/icon, price, activation, number available). The landmark entries should similarly be formatted as described in the game state section. The establishments should come first and be sorted by activation value, and the landmarks should come afterward and be sorted by cost. The final entry should be numbered "99" and should be the "do nothing" or "save for the next turn" option.

Most importantly, the options should **only** contain those establishments/landmarks that the player can both afford and is allowed to purchase/construct. For example, if a landmark has already been constructed by the player, it should not appear. If a major (purple) establishment has already been purchased by the player, it should not appear.

After the final 42-equals-sign line marking the end of the options, the prompt **must** be "Choose a number to purchase or construct:" The response **must** be one of the numbered options. Any other response should simply repeat the prompt.

The following is an example of such a menu:


    Player 1, would you like to purchase an   
    establishment or construct a landmark? (27 
    coins)                                    
    (To view details of an item, type 'view'  
    followed by the item number. For example, 
    to view item 6, type 'view 6'.)

    ========================================== 
    Choose a number to purchase or construct: 

###### Train Station Query
If a player has constructed the *Train Station*, they should be given the choice to roll 1 or 2 dice each turn. The prompt **must** be "Player *N*, would you like to roll 1 or 2 dice?" and the response should be either "1" or "2". Any other response should simply repeat the prompt.

###### Radio Tower Query
If a player has constructed the *Radio Tower*, they should be given the opportunity to reroll the die/dice once on their turn. The prompt **must** be "Player *N*, would you like to reroll the dice? (y/n):" and the response should be either "y" or "n". Any other response should simply repeat the prompt.

###### Choose Player Menu
If a player owns the *TV Station* or *Business Complex*, then their activations require selecting another player. In such cases, the prompt should be as follows, assuming Player 1 is the active player:

    -------     AVAILABLE PLAYERS      ------- 
    1. Player 3             (3 coins)         
    Player 1, who would you like to target?   

Since there are at most 4 players in the game, the numbered options only use one digit for the response, followed by a dot/period, followed by a space. Then the player's name/number is provided as a 20-character, left-aligned, space-padded string, followed by a space, followed by the number of coins that player has in parentheses.

For the *TV Station* only opponents who have a positive number of coins should be listed. For the *Business Complex* all opponents who have any available properties to select should be listed, regardless of their coin balances. (Note that the *Business Complex* cannot trade the purple properties, nor can it trade starting properties. So if a player **only** had a single *Wheat Field* and *Bakery* with some purple properties, they would not be a target for the *Business Complex*.)

###### Choose Establishment Menu
If a player owns the *Business Complex*, then its activation requires selecting an opponent's establishment and one of the player's establishments (both non-starting and non-purple) to swap. In such cases, the prompt should be as follows, assuming Player 1 is the active player and Player 3 has been selected as the opponent:

    -------  AVAILABLE ESTABLISHMENTS  ------- 
                     Player 3                 
     1. Wheat Field        BW (1)  [1]        
     2. Ranch              BC (1)  [2]        
     3. Bakery             GB (1)  [2-3]      
     4. Cafe               RU (2)  [3]        
     5. Convenience Store  GB (2)  [4]        
     6. Forest             BG (3)  [5]        
     7. Mine               BG (6)  [9]        
     8. Family Restaurant  RU (3)  [9-10]     
     9. Apple Orchard      BW (3)  [10]       
    10. Farmers Market     GO (2)  [11-12]    
    Player 1, select an establishment:        
    -------  AVAILABLE ESTABLISHMENTS  ------- 
                     Player 1                 
     1. Wheat Field        BW (1)  [1]        
     2. Forest             BG (3)  [5]        
     3. Furniture Factory  GF (3)  [8]        
     4. Mine               BG (6)  [9]        
     5. Apple Orchard      BW (3)  [10]       
     6. Farmers Market     GO (2)  [11-12]    
    Player 1, select an establishment:        

The establishments should be formatted as in the other menus and sorted by activation order. Only establishments that can be swapped (non-starting/non-purple) should be listed. It should never happen that such a menu is empty because that player should not have been an option as a target.


### Directory Structure
The directory structure that is assumed by Gradle (it can be changed if you want, but that requires changes to the Gradle build file) is as follows:

    project root  (root directory of project)
               |
                - build.gradle  (contains the instructions for the build tasks)
               |
                - establishments  (JSON files for the establishments for all phases are here)
               |
                - gradlew  (the Unix Gradle script)
               |
                - gradlew.bat  (the Windows Gradle script)
               |
                - gradle  (all configuration and scripts for the Gradle wrapper go here)
               |
                - src  (root directory of the source code; acceptance, main, test)
                    |
                     - main  (root directory of normal source code)

After you run `gradlew build`, a new **build** directory will automatically be created. This will contain all of the generated files (compiled class files, JAR files, reports, etc.). The most important things here are as follows:

**build/reports/tests/test/index.html**
: This file holds the results of all of the unit tests.

**build/libs/machiwoco.jar**
: This file is the fully bundled code for the project. You can run this by saying
  `java -jar build/libs/machiwoco.jar` from the project root.

After you run `gradlew cucumber`, a **reports/cucumber** directory will be created in the **build** directory. This will contain the reports for the acceptance tests.

**build/reports/cucumber/index.html**
: This file holds the Cucumber acceptance test results.

After you run `gradlew jacocoTestReport`, a **reports/jacoco/test/html** directory will be created in the **build** directory. This will contain the reports for the Jacoco code coverage.
  
**build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html**
: This file holds the unit test code coverage results from JaCoCo.

After you run `gradlew javadoc`, a **docs** directory will be created within the **build** directory. This will contain all of the generated Javadoc documentation for your source files.  

**build/docs/javadoc/index.html**
: This file is the index to the generated documentation.

## Full Console Playthrough
---------------------------
A complete game using the console interface between a single human player and two AI players is presented below. It is provided here as a reference for both how the game is played and how the console interface should look and behave. Note that the player's responses to the prompts do not appear here because they were entered on the terminal. However, the choices that were made are clear from the subsequent output from the program.


    The game has started. Player 1 will go    
    first.                                    
    Turn started for Player 1.
